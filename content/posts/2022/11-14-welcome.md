Hello there, my name is Austin! I'm a .NET Developer, musician,
[somewhat infrequent podcaster](https://usecasepod.github.io),
and creator of [the Louisiana Historical Markers app](https://github.com/awebre/la-historical-markers).

Recently, I've undertaken setting up my own vanity Mastodon server
([social.thewebres.com](https://social.thewebres.com)),
which I'm currently hosting on Linode VPS. In an effort to reduce costs,
I'm currently planning on migrating that Mastodon instance to a Le Potatoe
(because Raspberry Pi's are impossible to come by right now).
So I'm hopeful that the first series of posts will involve documenting the process for getting
Mastodon running on a tiny piece of hardware, as well as how to migrate an existing Mastodon instance
_off of the cloud_ (an unusual move, I know).

I am notorious for starting these kinds of projects and not following them all the way through...
hopefully writing this down will compel me to keep making progress. If not, this may be the world's shortest lived blog! üòÅ
