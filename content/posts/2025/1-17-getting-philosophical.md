I recently took a new opportunity at a new company and was quickly faced with a challenge that was totally new to me: how do you create a hiring process from scratch? Up until this point, the company had leaned on it's network to hire a small team of incredibly competent people, most of whom had worked together before. As we grow, how can we ensure that base line of competency is kept and that the team continues to work well together?

### What Makes Someone Successful?
When I first sat down to think this through, my initial thoughts went back to the interviews and hiring situations I had been through in my career. This left me nervous, as I felt that both as an interviewee and an interviewer I was often left with the nagging feeling that there just wasn't enough useful information being communicates. I had seen first hand how people would get one idea about a company or the hire only for the reality to fall far short of expectations. So how do we set up the team and the prospective hire for success?

Of course, I went to the internet to kick start my thinking on the matter. Having filled my head with articles (including some especially helpful resources in [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://www.pragmaticengineer.com)), I began to develop a systematic approach to answering this question and, ultimately, developing the core if a hiring process.

It starts with taking a slightly different angle on the question: "What Makes _Our Team_ Successful?"

I started thinking individually about the high performers on our teams. What do they bring to the table? I believe that thinking about individuals in particular is useful because each may bring out a different set of characteristics or traits, but you are also likelu to discover some similarities across many. Though I didnt know it at the time, this is fairly similar to a technique employed by Meta to identify high performers. In their case, they have formalized these different types of individuals into a set of "archetypes" that each have names and a particular "style" of high performance.

I began to write down some of these traits. At first the list was broad, but I began slowly narrowing it down. I did this by choosing carefully between traits that are closely linked and attempting to prioritize traits by percieved impact. Its not as rigorous a process and an engineering-minded individual might like, but it was a highly valuable and insightful experience for me. At the end, I had a list of key characteristics I felt were most valuable. On their own, several of them were fairly cliche (for example, Pragmatism and Autonomy), but with each I included a single sentence explaining why this characteristic is absolutely necessary to succeed. Framing it in this manner was also helpful for weeding out "weaker" characteristics.

### Gathering Signals

From here the process turns to the question of how to determine if an individual has those particular characteristics. Borrowing from The Pragmatic Engineer, I decided to call these Signals. In short, a Signal is a generic action or impact that an individual can demonstrate that speaks to a specific characteristic. For example, highlighting a risk to management would be a Signal that an individual is Pragmatic, whereas an ability to unblock themselves is a Signal of Autonomy. These Signals are patterns that can be matched to when discussing work history, tackling coding problems, or even just exchanging pleasantries.

As I began to flesh out these Signals, I did notice that there was a "strength" dimension to them. Some Signals fealt "greater" or "lesser" in their indication of a particular characteristic. My initial inclination was to throw out the "lesser" Signals, but I found a use for them in helping to determine level. I realized that many of the "lesser" Signals are those that can be demonstrated by someone earlier in their development. For example, a strong desire to learn new things is an early indicator of Autonomy, often demonstrated by entry-level candidates, whereas the ability to unblock yourself and others typically comes much later.


### Where Do We Go From Here?

Having laid out the Signals by Level and grouped them by Characteristic, the next step is to begin developing a question bank and evaluatiom sheets for each step of the process, focusing on the Signals that are best collected by that step. We're still in the thick of it there, so not much to report back yet, but I'm hoping to turn this into a series as we make our way through this process.
